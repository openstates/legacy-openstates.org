<h2>Categorization</h2>

<p>
One of the ways that we add value to the data we provide is by attempting to categorize bills, actions, and votes across states.
</p>

<h3>Bill Types</h3>
<p>Most state legislatures deal with more than bills.  Despite the name of the bill objects in our data we take in all types of legislation that a state might produce.  Generally looking at the bill_id will help you determine the type of legislation, but to make things easier across states we provide a <code>"type"</code> field on bills.

<p>
Possible values:
<ul>
    <li>bill</li>
    <li>resolution</li>
    <li>joint resolution</li>
    <li>concurrent resolution</li>
    <li>constitutional amendment</li>
</ul>
States with additional types might make use of additional types such as:
<ul>
    <li>contract</li>
    <li>nomination</li>
    <li>memorial</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Action Types</h3>
<p>Although most states follow very similar parlimentary procedure the names that their bill status systems use
for various actions almost never match up.  To make analysis and the building of certain types of tools easier
we attempt to categorize about 30 types of common actions.  In using our data you'll find these values in the
<code>"type"</code> field of actions.
</p>

<p>
Possible values:
<dl>
    <dt>bill:introduced</dt>
    <dd>Bill is introduced or prefiled</dd>

    <dd>The bill has failed to make it out of committee</dd>
    <dt>other</dt>
    <dd>All other actions will have a type of "other"</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>Vote Types</h3>
<p>Similarly to actions, we make an effort to categorize the motion being voted upon.  You'll find these values in the <code>"type"</code> field of vote objects.</p>

<p>
Possible values:
<dl>
    <dt>passage<dt>
    <dd>This is a vote to pass (either out of committee or a chamber)</dd>
    <dt>amendment</dt>
    <dd>Vote on amending a bill</dd>
    <dt>veto_override</dt>
    <dd>Vote to override an executive veto</dd>
    <dt>reading:1</dt>
    <dd>Vote on a first reading</dd>
    <dt>reading:2</dt>
    <dd>Vote on a second reading</dd>
    <dt>other</dt>
    <dd>All other votes</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3 id="subjects">Subjects</h3>
<p> Many states provide a list of subject areas for individual pieces of legislation.  We've made an attempt to map these to a comprehensive set of subjects.</p>

<p>If you're using the API data you'll find these in the <code>"subjects"</code> field if we've been able to categorize a state's bills.  If you're interested in the state's native categories those can be found in <code>"scraped_subjects"</code>.

<ul>
   <li>Agriculture and Food</li>
   <li>Animal Rights and Wildlife Issues</li>

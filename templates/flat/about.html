        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="fiveCol colLt">
            <p>Open States is a collection of tools that make it possible for citizens to
            track what is happening in their state's capitol by aggregating information
            from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.</p>

        <p>Using the site is simple: enter a U.S. address or select a state to start to research bills, review voting records, contact elected officials and more. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1dT3Vpl2SY">this Sunlight Academy tutorial</a> to see how Open States can help citizens, journalists and activists learn more about their state government.</p>

        <p>Open States was a project of the <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a> from 2009-2016.  <strong> As of November 2016 Open States is an independently run project</strong>, for more details see <a href="https://blog.openstates.org/post/adopting-open-states/">our announcement</a> and <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/11/01/sunlight-labs-update-nonprofits-step-up-to-preserve-tools-for-transparency/">Sunlight's announcement</a>.

            <p>All of our funding information is available <a href="/funding/"> on our funding page</a>.</p>

           <p> Additionally, collecting this data would not be possible without the support
            of a community much larger than the team here at Sunlight.  A special thanks to
            all of our volunteer <a href="https://github.com/openstates/openstates/graphs/contributors">contributors</a>
            and the authors and maintainers of all of the libraries that we depend upon.</p>

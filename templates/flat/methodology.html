<h2> Methodology </h2>

<p>
Open States relies primarily on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping">scraping</a> to collect
the data that we provide on this site.</p>
Scraping involves writing custom code to capture the information from each
state and as a result is known to be
error prone.  For example, if a state changes how they provide sponsor information
it'll require a manual fix on our end and in the interim our data may be incomplete.
</p>

<h4> Why Scrape? </h4>
<p>
Despite the known limitations, scraping is typically our best option
as most states do not make their data available in ways that are readily
repurposed to build sites such as this one.  Additionally, many states have
older, often somewhat unreliable systems, and although we make our best
effort to cope with the nuances of these systems there is always a chance
that we make a mistake.
</p>

<h4> Reporting Issues </h4>
<p>
If you notice something missing, please don't hesitate to
<a href="mailto:contact@openstates.org"> report it</a> and we'll
do our best to respond in a timely fashion.  If you're so inclined you can also
<a href="https://github.com/openstates/openstates.org"> report your issue directly</a>.
</p>

<h4> Other Changes </h4>
<p>
Aside from errors that may be introduced in the scrape process, we do not make
any modifications to the data that we scrape.  We augment the data in several
places such as linking legislators to their votes and adding categories to
actions and bills.  If you notice something incorrect you should also check the
source document (linked at the bottom of every page) and see if the error also
occurs on your state's website.  If the error exists on the source page there
is little we can do until it is fixed.  We recommend contacting them to see if
the issue can be fixed on their end.
</p>

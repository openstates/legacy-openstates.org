<h2> {% trans "Bulk Downloads" %} </h2>

Because it is often convenient to get all of a state's data for testing or offline use, we provide bulk downloads of our data.

We currently offer bulk data in two formats, JSON and CSV.


<h3>JSON Archives</h3>

The data contained in these downloads is in the same format as that obtained via the
<a href="http://docs.openstates.org/en/latest/api/">API</a>. (Refer to those pages for specifics on file formats.)

These downloads are not intended as a replacement for using the API.  The
main deficit you'll notice is that they lag up to a month (but usually not more)
behind the current data.  This makes them useful for general research
purposes or initializing a database that will then be kept up to date
via regular calls.  If you'd like more current data please use the API.

<h3>
    CSV Archives
</h3>

In addition to the JSON archives, we now also have CSV downloads available.

<a href="/csv_downloads/">Documentation on the CSV bulk files</a>.

Like the JSON archives, these aren't intended as a replacement for the API.
In addition to being older than the data provided via the API CSV files
do not reflect extra fields that the JSON files are able to include. This
is due to an inherent limitation of the CSV format. If extra fields are
required you should use the JSON downloads or API.
